# thread_support
Thread-safe data structures and algorithms in the C++ language.
Largely based on the examples and reasoning in Anthony Williams' guide book, "C++ Concurrency in Action"

Please make good use of these demonstrations :). I am a student, but I hope you'll find these data structures, applications and explanations instructive and/or helpful.



TODO: use the thread_queue in solve_equations.cpp

TODO: develop tests and applications for thread_stack

TODO: make thread_list, thread_forward_list, etc.

TODO: everything with Google Test.

TODO: Remove colon output from generate_math.cpp, and thus the need to ignore it in input in solve_equations
