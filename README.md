# thread_support
Thread-safe data structures and algorithms in the C++ language.
Largely based on the examples and reasoning in Anthony Williams' guide book, "C++ Concurrency in Action"

Please make good use of these demonstrations :). I am a student, but I hope you'll find these data structures, applications and explanations instructive and/or helpful.
